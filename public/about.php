						<p>I am currently a Codeup student, learning LAMP-stack and will graduate in September. As of right now, we have covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, all of which I am comfortable using when creating a website.</p>
						<p>I attended college for two years but left when I married my husband. After putting him through school and having a beautiful little boy, I wanted to re-invent myself. I didn't want to be "Hi, welcome to Orange Leaf," Ashley or "Good morning, this is Stewart Title Guaranty" Ashley. I wanted to be "Hi, I'm Ashley and I'm passionate about my job and what I do. Let me tell you about it," Ashley. After driving past the "Learn to Code - Codeup" billboard for a month, I decided I should look them up and I've loved every moment since.</p>
