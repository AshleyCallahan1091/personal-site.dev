						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">Coding is hard. </span>Being a mom is hard. Being a wife is hard. Going to school full-time is hard. Last week was hard, to be honest. My time is split between my husband, my son, Codeup, taking care of my apartment, my friends and my extended family that lives in San Antonio and somewhere in the mix of that, I have to take care of myself. More often than not, most of my time is spent at Codeup or working on coding projects while not there. I try my best to keep up with the coursework but sometimes, I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on so much to the point where I don&#39;t even know how to ask a question to get an idea of where to begin. When that happens, I end up doing a lot of practice work and projects outside of class to catch up and learn those skills I struggled with.</p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">Unfortunately, everything and everyone else </span> gets put on the back-burner, my me-time being the first thing on the chopping-block.</p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">This past week, </span>we covered requiring documents, objects and classes in PHP. When the assignments were given, I stared at them for ten minutes, convinced they were written in a foreign language. The lectures didn&#39;t make sense. Nothing made sense. For whatever reason, I could not grasp creating a log file that generates logs and messages. Because of this mental roadblock, I fell behind on several days&#39; worth of work. In the end, I did eventually catch up.

						<p class="blog-center"><span class="blog">But at what cost?</span></p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">I went three days </span>this week without seeing my husband, Sean. My apartment hadn&#39;t been cleaned in over a week. My sink smelled awful. I skipped meals because I just forgot to eat. My laundry sat in the dryer for days. I was behind on six assignments. I forgot my son&#39;s birthday. It meant late night Target trips because I forgot to get baby food and my babysitter was on her last day&#39;s worth of food and formula that ended with me sobbing into my friend&#39;s shoulder because what kind of mom and wife does that? The same mom who accidentally locked her keys and son in her truck that night. </p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">Thursday night, </span>after I got home super late from liberating my son from my truck with my dad&#39;s help, I had a choice. I could let this miserable week define me, or I could pick up the pieces and make the most of Friday.</p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">I showed up just before class started,</span> convinced Friday would just be a continuation of the previous four days after being stuck in two hours of traffic. But I got up, I showed up and I had nothing left to lose. It took reading and re-reading the material and working with a classmate and one of the teacher assistants for several hours during and thirty minutes after class to grasp the assignments. Let me tell you, it was very liberating to save and upload my work to my gitHub that afternoon. </p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">I got home Friday evening</span> and went straight to work. I cleaned my entire apartment from top to bottom, put away the week old laundry and threw a new load in the wash. Everything went back in its original home. I played with Declan and put him to bed at a reasonable time, which almost never happens. Once my apartment and my son received attention, I turned the focus on me. I put on a favorite movie <span class="blog blog-small">&#40;The Age of Adaline&#41;</span> and dug through my freezer for my pint of Ben & Jerry&#39;s that I save for bad days <span class="blog blog-small">&#40;Americone Dream&#41;</span> and let myself have some Pinterest time. When Sean woke up Saturday afternoon <span class="blog blog-small">&#40;he works nights and had already left when I got home Friday night&#41;</span>, we went out to lunch before Declan&#39;s birthday party. Things finally went back to normal.</p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">As you can see, </span> juggling family, friends and school is not for the faint-hearted and it brings about its own unique challenges. I have to remember to take a small amount of time for myself that doesn&#39;t include coding or doing anything resembling work, whether it&#39;s a movie night or baking cookies &#40;I love me some cookies&#41; or reading or just coloring. My family is important to me, as is school, but simultaneously managing them is difficult enough without the added stress of not taking care of myself. It was a tough lesson to learn after nine weeks of going and going and going and running on almost empty the entire time and but I&#39;m all the better for it. </p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">It&#39;s wonderful to be ambitious.</span> It&#39;s fantastic to pursue your dreams. Just promise yourself that you won&#39;t forget what&#39;s important now. On that list of important things, please please please don&#39;t forget to list yourself <span class="blog blog-small">&#40;and not just haphazardly at the bottom as an afterthought&#41;</span>. You can only do so much before you crack. Even if you do crack under pressure, take care of yourself before you break. You&#39;re no good to anyone else if you yourself are not 100% mentally, physically and emotionally well. </p>

						<p class="blog-left"><span class="blog">As a practically single mom,</span> I can assure you that I know it&#39;s difficult to put yourself first but please don&#39;t put yourself last on your list. If you are struggling, never hesitate to email or Skype me. </p>

						<p class="blog-center"><span class="blog">I believe in you even after you stop believing in yourself.</span></p>
