						<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">How do I use technology without going overboard?</span> </p>

						<p style="text-align: left;">That&#39;s a fair question, considering I spend a minimum of eight hours a day on my computer while in school, which is now at the halfway point of completion. It is insane how quickly the time has flown by. It seems like yesterday I had no idea what a foreach loop was and now I&#39;m iterating through arrays in my sleep. In these last eight weeks, I&#39;ve learned to look at technology in a completely different perspective. Before Codeup, I used my phone and computer for simple tasks&#58; talking, texting, scrolling through Pinterest, and taking pictures of my son. </p> 

						<img class="img-responsive img-border img-center" src="img/declan.jpg" alt="My handsome young man!">

						<p style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; font-size: 20px;">Can you blame me?</p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">Anyways, now I habitually check the Google Playstore,</span> for different apps that can be useful to me on a daily basis. How can I jot down a to-do list that pops in my head in a way that I&#39;ll actually be motivated to complete it without forgetting? How can I utilize time otherwise wasted driving through rush-hour traffic both ways to school? <span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 15px;">&#40;Aside from yelling at crazy drivers.&#41;</span> How can I streamline my average, day-to-day muting of my phone so no one has to hear my ringtone in class? <span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 15px;">&#40;Apparently not everyone loves Taylor Swift as much as me.&#41;</span> How can I avoid excess time wasted on Pinterest? <span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 15px;">&#40;There is NO way I&#39;m the only one in this boat.&#41;</span></p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"> <span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">My goal here</span> was to find apps that not only didn&#39;t require me to spend an hour inputting user information in order for it to work the way I wanted to but also would work on my behalf so I wouldn&#39;t have to waste time on mindless tasks &#40;i.e. muting my phone and forgetting to turn it back on but also vice versa.&#41; Here are my favorites:</p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">IFTTT &#40;phone&#41;: </span>If This, Then That. You can create your own &#39;recipes&#39; or use pre-made ones to streamline the simple tasks you don&#39;t want to waste time doing yourself. Remember that Twitter profile picture from 2010 you keep meaning to change but always forget? There&#39;s a recipe to sync your Facebook and Twitter profile pictures so you don&#39;t have to worry about potential employers seeing you at that party. You know the one I&#39;m talking about. All it requires is your login info from both sites. Want to mute your phone when you get to work? There&#39;s a recipe where all you do is input your work location and it does the work for you. Want your loved one to know you&#39;ve left the office but you don&#39;t want to text and drive? There&#39;s a recipe for that too.</p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">Google Drive &#40;phone and computer&#41;: </span>Google is essentially my life now. I have a Samsung Galaxy phone and pretty much everything is tied to my Google account. I am a writer on the side but because I&#39;m in school all day &#40;I leave at 7am, drop my son off and go straight to school, leave at 5:30, pick him up and get home by 7pm&#41; I feel bad if I don&#39;t spend the time after that with Declan and my husband when he wakes up &#40;he works nights&#41;. Once I get Declan to sleep, it&#39;s hit or miss if I&#39;m even awake still. Thus, my writing time takes a hit. Remember how I said I wanted to utilize the huge amount of wasted time on my way to and from school? Google Drive to the rescue! I set my phone up in my cupholder and just make voice memos as I drive and once I get to my destination, I save them and upload them to Google Drive. On my lunch breaks, I transcribe them on my computer &#40;and try not to accidentally include road rage snippets into my scenes&#41; and add to the scenes if I have time. I&#39;ve honestly written more in the last eight weeks than in the last year, all because I have nothing else to do in the car besides belting out hilariously off-key renditions of Taylor Swift songs.</p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">Mindly &#40;phone&#41;: </span>I hate generic checklists. I really do. My lists are not so simple. My husband tried to understand how my brain works by drawing it out on a whiteboardâ€¦.he ran out of space with all the dynamically changing lists and tasks I wanted to do in one day. Cue Mindly. I make a diagram of the different types of tasks, broken down by location and what time of day to do them. I map out my day so I know exactly what, when and where tasks need to get done so nothing gets forgotten.</p><br>

						<br><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">Trello &#40;phone and computer&#41;: </span>I use Trello like an interactive Pinterest board. I make boards for my projects and include the tasks that need to get done, along with mockups and templates of how I want it to look but it lets me add notes and it&#39;s not just a board I stare at and wonder when I&#39;ll actually find time to work on it. I can work straight from the app to sketch out ideas while I&#39;m on the go &#40;I&#39;m almost always on the go when I&#39;m not in class&#41;, save my progress and continue working on the actual project and incorporate those ideas when I can work on my computer. </p><br>

						<p style="text-align: left;">The great thing about familiarizing myself with these apps and trying so many new ones on a regular basis is that, while I love when I find something useful, it&#39;s even better when I can&#39;t find what I want because <span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;font-size: 20px;">that means I can make it myself</span> and design it to be exactly what I want. I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to find these apps and others to help me work much more efficiently so that I can spend my time creating the programs I want to see and use. I love that even when I&#39;m not at my computer, I can still work on projects, ideas and keep track of my progress and not have to worry about wasting time on car rides or waiting in a long line somewhere &#40;unless I&#39;m on Pinterest&#41;. So while I still use my phone for basic functions, it has now become a powerful tool of productivity that helps me surpass previous time constraints and limitations. 

						<p style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; font-size: 20px;">I&#39;m not tied to my computer but I&#39;m also not a slave to my cellphone. It&#39;s a liberating feeling. I can focus fully on my family for the few hours I get with them a day and still feel productive knowing I maximized the rest of my day.</p><br>
